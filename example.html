		<p>
			Because of the dynamic nature of our work, DOM and JavaScript function instances events can be all over the place.
			When the html often changes without a page reload it can be hard to keep track of their state.
			I created this script to avoid having to worry about the state of events and function instances when creating new HTML.
		</p>

		<h1>How it works</h1>
		<p>
			The point of this script is to keep your code as stateless as possible.
			The class instantiator has a scan function that scans a specific piece of html.
			If it finds DOM nodes with the <code data-language="html">data-widget</code> attribute on it, it locates the JavaScript function which is named like the <code data-language="html">data-widget</code> value and tries to instantiate it.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the function exists and it can be instantiated, the class instantiator saves the instance in a dictionary.
			<code data-language="javascript">widgetDictionary[&lt;HTMLElement&gt;][&lt;widgetInstance&gt;];</code>
		</p>

		<h3>Added benefit</h3>
		<p>
			The <code data-language="html">data-widget</code> tag gives extra semantics to the html and also enables less
			technical people to add JavaScript to a new piece of html in an easy way.
			Just add <code data-language="html">data-widget="tooltip"</code> and you are done.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>The class instantiator is only meant to be used for functions that interact with DOM nodes. It is not meant for functions which are only called once.</em>
		</p>

<pre><code data-language="html"><div id="my-awesome-html">
    <p>Nice <span data-widget="Tooltip" title="I am a Tooltip">text</span> about something.</p>
</div></code></pre>

<pre><code data-language="javascript">(function(ns)
{
    ns.ClassInstantiatorInstance = new ns.ClassInstantiator('widget');
    ns.ClassInstantiatorInstance.scan(document.getElementById('my-awesome-html'));

}(window.NAMESPACE = window.NAMESPACE || {}));
</code></pre>

		<p>Multiple widgets per DOM node are also possible. Just seperate them by a `;`.</p>
<pre><code data-language="html"><div id="my-awesome-html">
    <p>Nice <span data-widget="Tooltip;AnotherWidget" title="I am a Tooltip">text</span> about something.</p>
</div></code></pre>

		<h2>Public functions</h2>
		<p>
			When the instance has public functions you can access these by asking the widget dictionary to return the instance you want by supplying the DOM node and the widget name.
